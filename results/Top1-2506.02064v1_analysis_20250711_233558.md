Abstract
As industry reports claim agentic AI systems deliver double-digit productivity gains
and multi-trillion dollar economic potential, the validity of these claims has become
critical for investment decisions, regulatory policy, and responsible technology
adoption. However, this paper demonstrates that current evaluation practices for
agentic AI systems exhibit a systemic imbalance that calls into question prevailing
industry productivity claims. Our systematic review of 84 papers (2023–2025)
reveals an evaluation imbalance where technical metrics dominate assessments
(83%), while human-centered (30%), safety (53%), and economic assessments
(30%) remain peripheral, with only 15% incorporating both technical and human
dimensions. This measurement gap creates a fundamental disconnect between
benchmark success and deployment value. We present evidence from healthcare,
finance, and retail sectors where systems excelling on technical metrics failed in
real-world implementation due to unmeasured human, temporal, and contextual
factors. Our position is not against agentic AI’s potential, but rather that current

Introduction
Agentic AI systems are characterized by: (1) goal-directed behavior with the ability to decompose
complex objectives into manageable subtasks [20]; (2) environmental awareness and adaptability to
changing conditions [7]; (3) tool utilization, where agents strategically leverage external resources to
accomplish tasks [2]; and (4) autonomous decision-making with limited human intervention [34].
These systems are rapidly moving from research labs to critical real-world deployments, yet our

### 4. Evaluation Frameworks Remain Noticeably Imbalanced. We Define Measurement Imbalance As The

**Score: 8.0/10**

**Evaluation:**
Score: 8/10

Reasoning:

Clarity and Writing Quality (2/2):
The section is very well-written, with clear prose and a logical flow. The authors effectively communicate their central argument about evaluation framework imbalances. The writing is academic yet accessible, with a good balance of technical language and explanatory context.

Technical Depth (2/2):
The section demonstrates substantial technical depth. It provides a nuanced critique of current AI evaluation frameworks, citing specific benchmarks (MLAgentBench, ML-Bench, SUPER), and offering concrete examples from various domains like healthcare and trading. The authors show a sophisticated understanding of both technical metrics and broader evaluation challenges.

Novelty and Originality (1.5/2):
The argument about the imbalance in AI evaluation frameworks is quite novel. The systematic critique of how current benchmarks overemphasize technical performance while neglecting human-centered factors is an original and important contribution. The systematic review of 84 papers provides empirical weight to their argument.

Methodology Rigor (1/2):
While the methodology is not fully detailed in this section, the authors hint at a systematic literature review. More explicit explanation of their review methodology would strengthen this aspect.

Evidence and Support (1.5/2):
The section is well-supported with multiple citations across disciplines (HCI, machine learning, industry reports). The concrete example of healthcare diagnostic agents illustrates their point effectively. The statistical breakdown of their literature review (83% technical vs. 30% human-centered evaluation) provides strong evidential support.

Minor critiques include a small typo (∗corrspeonding) and the need for more methodological transparency. Overall, this is a high-quality section that makes a compelling argument about the current limitations in AI evaluation frameworks.

evaluation frameworks remain noticeably imbalanced. We define measurement imbalance as the
systematic bias in evaluation frameworks that privilege easily quantifiable technical metrics while
neglect dimensions critical to real-world deployment success; especially human-centered factors,
temporal stability, and contextual fit. This imbalance creates a fundamental misalignment between
what we measure and what determines system value. For instance, healthcare diagnostic agents

achieving 95% benchmark accuracy have been relegated to limited advisory roles post-deployment
due to unmeasured trust and workflow integration issues [17].
In 2024, agentic AI systems were deployed across sectors such as: clinical triage [3, 6], automated
trading [46, 44], customer service [13, 33], and internal software debugging [16, 32]. Firms report
double-digit productivity gains from these deployments, citing speed, cost savings, and increased
decision accuracy [28]. These claims are bolstered by benchmark results showcasing near-human or
superhuman performance on standard tasks [18, 4].
Benchmarks have long driven progress in machine learning, from ImageNet [10] to GLUE [42] and
HELM [25]. In the agentic AI space, MLAgentBench [18], ML-Bench [38], and SUPER [4] evaluate
task success, efficiency, and end-to-end execution using predefined scripts or repository-grounded
tasks. PlanBench [39] introduces symbolic validation for plan structure, while VisualWebArena [23]
focuses on multimodal agents in web environments. These frameworks provide critical infrastructure
for measuring technical competence but rarely assess how agents integrate into human workflows or
operate over time.
Meanwhile, HCI and social computing scholars have long emphasized trust, usability, and alignment
as critical success factors in AI deployment [37, 29]. Recent agentic AI work includes TrAAIT [36],
a validated instrument for clinician trust in AI systems; [30] highlights transparency and observability
needs; [11], propose a multi-axis framework for agent intelligence, adaptivity, and civility. How-
ever, these human-centered approaches remain fragmented with limited integration into standard
benchmarks or industry practice.
This disconnect between technical and sociotechnical evaluation is confirmed by our systematic review
of 84 academic and industry papers from 2023–2025. Among these works, technical performance
was strongly represented (83%), while human-centered evaluation appeared in 30%, and both in only
15%.
Despite the widespread enthusiasm and rapid adoption, we currently lack the multidimensional

evaluation tools required to validate the productivity and efficiency claims. Technical metrics, while
necessary, capture only a narrow slice of what determines success in real-world deployments. As
agentic systems gain more autonomy and become embedded in organizational workflows, this
measurement imbalance threatens to create a new wave of mismatched expectations, misallocated
resources, and poorly understood risks.
We argue that the prevailing evaluation frameworks for agentic AI are largely incomplete,
systematically privileging technical performance metrics while underrepresenting critical
dimensions such as human-centered interaction, longitudinal behavior, safety, and contextual
fit. As a result, the industry’s current productivity claims are premature and, in many cases,
can be misleading.
We do not argue against the value of agentic systems, nor do we dispute their emerging capabilities.
Instead, we focus on the instruments of validation; the metrics, benchmarks, and evaluation practices
that translate system behavior into evidence. Our central claim is that these instruments are misaligned
with deployment reality, and that evaluation itself must evolve if we are to responsibly scale agentic
AI in high-stakes domains.
Benchmark-driven optimization has long been the engine of ML progress, but when benchmarks miss
key dimensions of impact, they also drive blind spots. What we measure shapes what we build. As
venues for foundational work in LLMs, agent architectures, and evaluation benchmarks, leading AI
conferences are well-positioned to catalyze this needed shift toward more comprehensive evaluation
practices
This paper takes a position grounded in both empirical evidence and practical urgency, offering the
following contributions: (1) A quantitative diagnosis of the current imbalance. Our meta-analysis of

evaluations. (2) Illustrating deployment consequences with real-world examples. We document
how overreliance on narrow evaluation metrics led to adoption failure or unexpected business losses
in healthcare, financial services, and retail deployments. (3) A new theoretical framework for
balanced evaluation. We introduce a four-axis model; technical, human, temporal, and contextual, and
propose a formal structure for integrating multiple metric classes across domains. (4) Anticipation
and rebuttal of key counterarguments. We address recurring counterarguments including: that

human-centered metrics are too subjective; that safety and governance belong to regulators, not ML
researchers and thus our of scope; that adding more metrics slows interaction and stifles innovation;
that one size cannot fit all domains, and universal frameworks are inherently vague. (5) Actionable
recommendations for researchers, industry, and policymakers. We offer a roadmap for closing the
measurement gap through benchmark design, instrument development, deployment best practices,
and regulatory levers.
By grounding what we count as evidence, this paper aims to reset the conversation on agentic AI
efficiency, not to constrain innovation, but to ensure that the claims we make reflect the systems we
actually build (see Appendix A.4 for formal definitions).
2
Why Evaluation Matters
Unlike classical predictive models, Agentic AI value hinges on sustained interaction with people,
data sources, and other agents across time and domains. As these systems rapidly transition from
research to deployment in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail, the gap between how
we evaluate them and how they actually create value becomes critical.
MLAgentBench [18] is an example of today’s technical focus: agents are scored on Pass@k success,
token efficiency, and wall-clock time while running scripted ML experiments. The benchmark yields
crisp, automatable numbers but tells us nothing about how well an agent fits a collaborative workflow
or whether its behavior degrades after extended autonomous operation.
By contrast, TrAAIT, a clinician-trust instrument for AI decision support, captures perceived useful-
ness, ease of integration, and social influence through validated survey scales [36]. TrAAIT’s scores
directly predict real-world adoption but is rarely included in research papers. The field celebrates
technical benchmark leaderboards while few report trust or usability scores, reflecting a marked
misalignment between what we measure and what determines deployment success.
Systems that ace technical benchmarks can still be rejected by end-users if trust, workflow compati-
bility, or explanation quality are weak (adoption risk). Point-in-time accuracy masks drift, emergent
behavior, and edge-case failure modes that surface only after deployment, creating potential for harm
that remains invisible to current evaluation frameworks (safety blind spots). ROI projections based
solely on speed or accuracy overlook human oversight costs and adaptation lags, leading to costly
rollout reversals and failed investments (misjudged productivity).
When optimize for the same narrow slice of metrics, the research community and industry alike are
effectively flying blind on the dimensions that determine real-world success. To unlock the genuine
productivity potential of agentic AI and to avoid a wave of failed deployments and eroded trust,
we must rebalance evaluation toward a multidimensional, longitudinal, and context-aware basis.
The remainder of this paper supplies the evidence, framework, and agenda required to make that
shift, drawing on instances across sectors where measurement imbalance has already led to costly
consequences.

Methodology
We conducted systematic searches across arXiv and Google Scholar. Search terms included combina-
tions of “agentic AI”, “AI agents”, “LLM agents”, “evaluation”, “benchmark”, “assessment”, and
“metric”. Papers were included if (1) published between January 2023 and April 2025, (2) focused
on agentic or LLM-based systems as defined in Section 1, (3) available in English, (4) proposed or
applied evaluation methodology and metrics.
Two reviewers independently screened 138 papers (with 85% agreement), with disagreements resolved
by a third reviewer. Out of 138 papers, 84 of them met our inclusion criteria. We adopted a four-
category scheme that was developed through an iterative process based on established AI evaluation
metrics [43], pilot coding of 25 papers, and inter-reliability testing. These four metric categories are:
Technical such as task success rate, accuracy, latency, throughput, human-centered such as trust,
usability, collaboration, workflow integration, safety and governance such as robustness, compliance,
explainability, alignment, and economic impact such as ROI, cost savings, value realization. We

may not be captured here.
3.2
Data Analysis
In our analysis of qualified papers technical metrics dominated (83%), while human-centered and
economic impact metrics were less common (both 30%). Notably, only 15% of papers included both
technical and human-centered metrics, and a mere 5% incorporated any longitudinal dimension (de-
tailed distributions in Appendix A.3).
Academic papers were more likely to emphasize standardized technical benchmarks (96% vs. 87%),
while industry publications more frequently included economic (39% vs. 14%) and human-centered
(57% vs. 34%) metrics. However, only a small minority in either group employed multidimensional
or longitudinal evaluation strategies.
Technical metrics were also the most standardized, with 72% referencing formal benchmarks. Human-
centered and economic metrics, by contrast, were mostly ad hoc or qualitative, with only 18% and
12% respectively using validated instruments. Safety and governance metrics fell in between, often
borrowing from emerging regulatory standards.
These patterns can show a bias toward metrics that are automatable, replicable, and leaderboard-
friendly. While useful for measuring discrete capabilities, they ignore the dimensions that determine
real-world value such as human alignment, safety resilience, and temporal stability. Consequently,
the evidence base becomes structurally unbalanced, prioritizing narrow optimization over deployment
risk.
4
Case-Study Accounts: When Metrics Fail
Quantitative analysis alone cannot reveal the human and organizational consequences of evaluation
gaps. This section presents real-world deployments across healthcare, finance, and retail where
systems that performed strongly on benchmark metrics failed to deliver anticipated value. In each
case, critical dimensions—trust calibration, workflow integration, temporal stability, and contextual
fit—were either unmeasured or misrepresented in initial evaluation, leading to adoption breakdowns
or business losses.
4.1
Healthcare: Diagnostic Support Systems that Failed to Integrate
The healthcare sector provides evidence that technical accuracy does not guarantee real-world success.
AI diagnostic agents deployed across hospitals often demonstrate high performance in controlled
tests; typically 90–95% diagnostic accuracy and superior documentation completeness compared to
junior residents [22].
Based on these benchmarks, institutions projected significant workload reduction and multi-million
dollar savings [31]. Yet post-deployment assessments frequently report adoption challenges. Although
the healthcare sector generates over one-third of global data, only an estimated 3% is effectively used
in live deployments [35]. A Turing Institute study found that medical triage systems with strong lab
metrics made “little to no difference” in clinical workflows [17].
Misalignment stemmed from evaluations conducted in environments that did not mirror real-world
complexity or workflow patterns [36]. For instance, DoctorBot, a self-diagnosis chatbot used by over
16,000 users in China, struggled with generalization and usage outside its training scope, despite high
test scores [14].
Recent work from UMass Amherst found hallucinations in “almost all” AI-generated medical
summaries by top LLMs including GPT-4o and LLaMA-3 [40]. These systems, while objectively
fluent, imposed hidden verification burdens on clinicians. Trust calibration remained low, and the
promised 40% workload reduction often went unrealized due to poor integration into existing routines.
4
When these issues surface post-deployment, systems are typically downgraded to limited advisory
roles. Studies estimate that projected ROI drops by 70–80% [12], revealing how failure to evaluate
human, temporal, and contextual dimensions undermines deployment success.
Here failures reflect neglect of human-centered, temporal, and contextual dimensions, despite high
technical scores.
4.2
Financial Services: Investment Agents Vulnerable to Market Shifts
In finance, agentic AI systems assist with portfolio optimization and compliance, often excelling in
historical backtesting and rule adherence. Benchmark performance ranges from 85–90% accuracy on
simulated tasks [19].
Yet these systems frequently degrade under real-world volatility. A study found that performance
deteriorated rapidly within months of deployment [1], due to poor generalization in dynamic en-
vironments. Vydyanathan [41] highlights how autonomous agents, when left unmonitored, make
misaligned portfolio adjustments that violate human expectations.
Moreover, simultaneous reactions by AI agents to market shifts can produce emergent “herd behavior,”
exacerbating volatility instead of stabilizing it [27]. This dynamic risk remains invisible to static

evaluation metrics.
Legal and regulatory risks are mounting as well. A Canadian tribunal held Air Canada liable when its
AI assistant gave incorrect fare guidance [45], establishing that firms are accountable for AI missteps.
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau similarly reported that poor chatbot design led to
widespread customer harm, fees, and trust breakdowns [5].
These examples underscore the need for financial AI evaluation to go beyond accuracy and compliance,
integrating stress tests, scenario robustness, and human-agent interpretability metrics.
Here evaluation failed to account for temporal, human-centered, and contextual vulnerabilities in
volatile and regulated domains.
4.3
Retail: Customer Support Systems That Damaged Experience
Retail AI agents often succeed in early testing: reducing handling time by 70–80% and passing
compliance with over 95% accuracy [9]. However, real-world use reveals significant customer
experience degradation.
These systems struggle with edge cases and nuanced interactions [26]. A prominent example was
McDonald’s AI drive-thru system, which failed after a multi-year collaboration with IBM. Viral videos
showed repeated misunderstandings, including one where the AI added 260 Chicken McNuggets to
an order [8]. The system was ultimately shut down.
DPD’s delivery chatbot was manipulated into swearing at a customer and composing a self-critical
poem [15]. In New York, the MyCity chatbot dispensed illegal business advice, such as permitting
employers to fire workers for reporting harassment [24].
These incidents damaged brand trust and led to project cancellations. Although internal projections
often promise high ROI—such as $0.67 profit per dollar invested [21]—they rarely account for fallout
in Net Promoter Score (NPS), repeat contacts, or cart abandonment, which routinely worsen by
15–40% [28].
Despite high technical efficiency, failures in human-centered experience and contextual alignment led
to business losses.
4.4
The Evaluation Gap
Across all three domains, we observe a consistent pattern: benchmark performance drove optimistic
ROI projections that failed to materialize. Reports estimate that agentic AI systems could contribute
$4.4 trillion in productivity gains [31], but realized returns are often less than 25% of forecasts [28].
5
This disconnect arises from systematically omitting or underweighting evaluation of human interac-
tion, adaptability over time, and domain-specific constraints. The result is a persistent gap between
perceived and actual value, exposing organizations to reputational, legal, and financial risks.
Key Insight: Narrow evaluation of technical metrics alone provides a misleading picture of system
readiness. Multidimensional evaluation, across human, temporal, and contextual axes, is essential for
deployment-aligned assessment.

A Balanced Framework for Evaluating Agentic AI
The failures highlighted in Section 4 are not isolated accidents. They reflect a systemic overemphasis
on technical correctness at the expense of human, temporal, and contextual factors. To realign

evaluation with real-world success, we propose a framework that balances these dimensions, supports
domain adaptation, and maintains practical feasibility.
5.1
Core Axes of Evaluation
Our framework is organized around four primary evaluation axes, each representing a distinct aspect
of system behavior:
Technical (T): Measures discrete system performance on well-defined tasks. This includes traditional
metrics such as success rates (Pass@k), accuracy, latency, resource efficiency, and structural fidelity.
These metrics are necessary foundations but insufficient predictors of deployment success.
Human-centered (H): Captures how users experience, interpret, and adapt to the system. This
dimension includes trust calibration (the alignment between system confidence and user trust),
usability (cognitive load, ease of use), collaboration quality (hand-off effectiveness, interruption
management), and mental model accuracy. These factors directly influence adoption rates and realized
performance.
Temporal (R): Assesses stability and adaptability over time. This includes performance drift (how
accuracy changes with shifting conditions), adaptation rates (learning curves for both system and
users), knowledge retention (consistency across sessions), and value alignment stability (resistance to
goal corruption). Temporal metrics are essential for systems that evolve during use and face changing
conditions.
Contextual (C): Evaluates alignment with domain-specific constraints and objectives. This includes
regulatory compliance, risk exposure (financial, reputational, safety), economic impact (ROI, effi-
ciency gains), and workflow integration. These metrics reflect how well the system functions within
organizational and sectoral ecosystems.
While distinctly defined, these dimensions are not independent variables but rather form an intercon-
nected system, as we explore in the next section.
5.2
Dimensional Interdependence
A key insight from our case studies is that dimensions don’t operate in isolation. Instead, they form a
complex, interdependent system where changes in one dimension inevitably affect others (Fig. 1).
Technical ↔Human-centered: Technical performance directly shapes user trust and experience,
while human feedback and usage patterns influence technical effectiveness. In healthcare deployments,
even systems with >95% diagnostic accuracy failed when clinicians lacked calibrated trust, leading
them to either over-rely on or dismiss system recommendations.
Technical ↔Temporal: Technical design choices determine long-term stability and adaptability,
while temporal patterns reveal technical strengths and weaknesses. Financial AI systems that excelled
in optimization tasks based on historical market data but lacked robust adaptation mechanisms showed
significant performance degradation during market volatility.
Technical ↔Contextual: Technical capabilities define what’s possible within domain constraints,
while contextual factors establish requirements and limitations for technical approaches. In retail,
technically efficient systems that failed to align with customer emotional expectations damaged brand
perception and reduced sales.

Figure 1: Interdependencies across agentic AI evaluative metric dimensions.
Human-centered ↔Temporal: User trust and mental models evolve over time, while system
predictability and stability shape user expectations and behaviors. Trust calibration issues often
compound over time, with initial minor discrepancies evolving into significant usage problems.
Human-centered ↔Contextual: Human experiences are shaped by organizational context and
workflow fit, while user behavior determines how contextual value is realized. Systems that failed to
integrate smoothly into established workflows were rejected despite strong technical performance.
Temporal ↔Contextual: Temporal adaptation must align with changing regulatory and business
environments, while contextual factors determine what kinds of adaptation are valuable or permissible.
Systems that couldn’t adapt to seasonal retail patterns or evolving healthcare guidelines quickly lost
their initial value.
These interdependencies may explain why single-dimension evaluation approaches often fail to
predict real-world outcomes. Systems optimized solely for technical metrics may create unforeseen
problems in other dimensions that only become apparent during deployment.
5.3
Framework Implementation Across Domains
To make our framework practical across different sectors, we propose an implementation approach
that balances standardization with domain specificity. At the center lies a minimal core evaluation
set, one foundational metric per axis, sufficient to provide an initial balanced assessment. From this
foundation, each domain extends the framework with specialized metrics that address sector-specific
needs while maintaining awareness of cross-dimensional effects.
Healthcare implementations tend to prioritize technical accuracy and human trust, financial services
extend further on regulatory compliance and temporal stability, while retail emphasizes human
satisfaction and contextual business metrics.
The implementation process should explicitly track interdimensional effects. For example, when
improving diagnostic accuracy in healthcare, teams should simultaneously monitor changes in trust
calibration, alert fatigue, and workflow integration to capture ripple effects across the system.
This structure supports both cross-domain comparability and contextual depth. It also enables scalable

evaluation that is minimum viable testing at early stages, and deep analysis before full deployment.
5.4
Metric Interaction Formalism
To formalize our approach to balancing multiple metrics, we define a system’s real-world effectiveness
score. Let T, H, R, and C be normalized scores (0–1) for technical, human-centered, temporal, and
contextual metrics respectively. We define a system’s real-world effectiveness score U as:
7
U = wT T + wHH + wRR + wCC
where
X
wi = 1
In current practice, wT ≈1 and all others are near zero, implicitly treating technical success as a
proxy for overall value. But evidence from Section 3 and Section 4 shows this fails to predict actual
outcomes.
We argue that deployment-critical use cases (e.g., clinical decision support, financial compliance)
require a balanced weighting scheme. For instance, (wT , wH, wR, wC) = (0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.25),
with calibration dependent on risk tolerance and domain complexity.
This formalism clarifies trade-offs and helps guide decisions during evaluation design. A system
scoring 0.9 on T but 0.2 on H and R may appear strong under conventional evaluation, yet would
score only 0.55 under our balanced framework, correctly flagging potential deployment issues.
Beyond simple weighted combinations, advanced implementations should also consider interaction
effects between dimensions. For example, the combination of low trust calibration H with high
adaptation rate R can create particularly problematic outcomes in financial systems responding to
market volatility.
Organizations can implement this framework through a phased approach that balances thoroughness
with practical constraints.Appendix A.2 provides a practical implementation example.
5.5
Anticipating and Addressing Counterarguments
We anticipate four common objections to expanding evaluation beyond technical metrics:
“Human-centered metrics are too subjective to trust.” Response: Subjectivity is not noise. It
reflects user experience, which governs adoption and safety. Instruments like TrAAIT, NASA-TLX,
and trust calibration curves have shown strong correlation with deployment outcomes. These can be
standardized, validated, and benchmarked.
“Safety and governance are outside the research scope; leave them to regulators.” Response:
Safety, like accuracy, is an engineering problem first. Early design decisions shape emergent behaviors
and risk profiles. Deferring evaluation until regulation is reactive and dangerous especially for rapidly
evolving systems.
“More metrics slow development and hinder innovation.” Response: Our framework is modular
and scalable. Core metrics can be collected with minimal overhead, while deeper evaluation can
be phased in during later stages. In fact, catching trust or adaptation issues early often accelerates
deployment by reducing backtracking.
“One-size-fits-all frameworks can’t handle domain differences.” Response: That’s why our
quadrant is extensible. The inner core supports cross-domain baselining, while outer layers incor-
porate sector-specific requirements. This mirrors how safety standards operate in aerospace vs.
pharmaceuticals; different in detail, unified in structure.
This framework is not just a theoretical construct, it is designed for implementation. The next section
provides concrete recommendations for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers to adopt,
extend, and apply the model in practice.

Recommendations and Research Agenda
Addressing the measurement imbalance in agentic AI requires coordinated action across research,
deployment, and governance communities. We propose the following priorities:
6.1
Research Community
Develop and validate human-centered evaluation instruments and temporal metrics across domains.
Design cross-domain benchmarks that integrate human dimensions, safety, and long-term perfor-
mance beyond task correctness.
8
Create lightweight evaluation toolkits based on our quadrant framework, while incentivizing
multidimensional reporting in publications through structured requirements.
Bridge disciplines by fostering collaboration between technical AI fields and HCI, safety engineering,
and organizational science.
6.2
Industry Practitioners
Implement comprehensive pre-deployment evaluations across all four axes (technical, human,
temporal, contextual) and track longitudinal agent behavior.
Adopt trust-focused approaches by measuring user interpretation and calibration early, while
integrating staged evaluation into existing workflows.
Enhance evaluation quality by including domain experts in metric design and transparently reporting

Coding Schema for Meta-Analysis
To characterize the evaluation focus of recent agentic AI literature across four key metric dimensions:
technical performance, human-centered evaluation, safety/governance, and economic impact. Each
publication was coded based on whether it included at least one metric or instrument aligned with
each dimension. Both peer-reviewed academic publications and industry white papers were eligible.
Papers were included in the review if they met all of the following:
• Timeframe: Published between January 2023 and April 2025
• System Type: Described evaluation of an agentic AI system (LLM-based agents, multi-agent
systems, autonomous decision-makers, or LLM tool users)
• Evaluation Evidence: Included at least one stated metric or evaluation result related to
agent/system performance, user interaction, safety, or deployment outcomes
Each paper was coded using a binary vector [T, H, S, E], corresponding to Table 1. Papers were

independently reviewed twice with a structured evaluation checklist (see below). Any ambiguity were
resolved by a third reviewer. Full data and coded records are available in the accompanying CSV file.
Metric Inclusion Checklist
For each publication, the following yes/no questions were used:
• T1: Does the paper report a performance metric on a specific task or benchmark?
• T2: Is any computational or latency efficiency reported?
• T3: Does the paper compare performance across different model versions, sizes, or against
baseline systems?

Figure 2: Framework implementation through a phased approach.
• H1: Are human users (or proxies) involved in the evaluation?
• H2: Are trust, satisfaction, collaboration, or user behavior metrics reported?
• H3: Does the paper measure learnability, ease of use, or cognitive load aspects of the agent?
• S1: Are safety, failure rates, or edge case behaviors explicitly measured?
• S2: Are governance, compliance, or alignment frameworks included?
• S3: Are bias, fairness, ethical considerations, or representational harms measured or dis-
cussed with metrics?
• E1: Is business impact, ROI, or operational efficiency tracked?
• E2: Are KPIs from real-world deployment or simulations discussed?
• E3: Is scalability, cost-effectiveness at scale, or long-term economic viability evaluated?
• Q1: Is the evaluation methodology described in sufficient detail for reproducibility?
• Q2: Does the paper explicitly acknowledge limitations of the evaluation approach?
• Q3: Does the evaluation use multiple, complementary methods (triangulation) to validate
findings?
If any question within a category was answered “yes” that dimension received a 1. If metrics simulate
human experience (e.g., using an LLM to approximate user satisfaction), the paper was still marked
H=1, with a flag for “simulated human” noted separately. Studies reporting only unstructured user
impressions were excluded unless accompanied by coded instruments, clear KPIs, or quantifiable
outcomes. Papers focused on emergent behavior or coordination were marked T=1, and S=1 if failure
modes or robustness were analyzed.
A.2
Practical Implementation Process
Organizations can implement this framework through a phased approach that balances thoroughness
with practical constraints:
• Baseline Assessment (phase 1): Establish core metrics across all four dimensions.
– Technical: Benchmark task completion and accuracy
– Human: Conduct initial trust calibration studies
13
– Temporal: Measure baseline stability in controlled conditions
– Contextual: Assess initial workflow fit and compliance requirements
• Domain Adaptation (phase 2): Select and calibrate domain-specific extensions
– Identify sector-specific validation instruments
– Define interdependence monitoring approach
– Establish evaluation thresholds based on deployment criticality
• Pilot Evaluation (phase 3): Apply the framework to controlled deployments
– Collect longitudinal data across all dimensions
– Monitor cross-dimensional effects
– Adjust weights based on observed interdependencies
• Full Integration (ongoing): Incorporate into development cycles and deployment decisions
– Maintain dimensional balance throughout scaling
– Regular reassessment as system and context evolve
– Proactive monitoring of emerging interdependence effects
This phased approach balances comprehensiveness with real-world constraints, allowing organizations
to begin shifting toward balanced evaluation without disrupting innovation cycles (Fig. 2).

Terms and Definitions
Agentic AI systems: Systems characterized by: (1) goal-directed behavior with the ability to decom-
pose complex objectives into manageable subtasks; (2) environmental awareness and adaptability to
changing conditions; (3) tool utilization, where agents strategically leverage external resources to
accomplish tasks; and (4) autonomous decision-making with limited human intervention.
Measurement imbalance: The systemic bias in evaluation frameworks that privilege easily quan-
tifiable technical metrics while neglecting dimensions critical to real-world deployment success;
14
especially human-centered factors, temporal stability, and contextual fit. This creates a fundamental
misalignment between what we measure and what determines system value.
Technical metrics: Measures discrete system performance on well-defined tasks.

• Usability or workload measures (e.g., NASA-TLX)
• Collaboration effectiveness, workflow integration
• simulated human ratings (e.g., Agent-as-a-Judge)

standards.
• Adversarial robustness, value alignment, error recovery
• Failure rate analysis, regulatory compliance metrics
• Explainability metrics, fairness audits
• Code-based autonomy scoring (e.g., orchestration code inspection)
• Bias, fairness, ethical considerations, or representational harms measurements
Economic & business impact metrics: Assesses financial and operational value creation.
